1. Build a client-side React interface for the server you created!

2. Your app should be a CRUD application - it should be able to: 

- Create (POST) new bounties

- Read (GET) existing bounties and show them to the user of your site

- Update (PUT) existing bounties (e.g. if you wanted to up the price for a bounty)

- Delete (DELETE) bounties from the list of all bounties.
